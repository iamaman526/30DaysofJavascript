    <!-- Variables are containers of data. Variables are used to store data in a memory location. When a variable is declared, a memory location is reserved. When a variable is assigned to a value (data), the memory space will be filled with that data. To declare a variable, we use var, let, or const keywords. -->

    <script>
      // Declaring different variables of different data types
      let firstName = "aman";
      let lastName = "kumar";
      let country = "india";
      let city = "patna";
      let age = 24;
      let isMarried = false;

      console.log(firstName, lastName, country, city, age, isMarried);

      // Declaring variables with number values
      let Age = 100;
      const gravity = 9.81;
      const boilingPoint = 100;
      const PI = 3.14;
      console.log(Age, gravity, boilingPoint, PI);

      // Variables can also be declaring in one line separated by comma, however I recommend to use a seperate line to make code more readble

      let name = "AMAN",
        job = "STUDENT",
        live = "INDIA";
      console.log(name, job, live);
