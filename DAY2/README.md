# DATA TYPES

### Data types can be divided into two:

1-Primitive data types

2-Non-primitive data types(Object References)

## Primitive Data Types

### Primitive data types in JavaScript include:

1-Numbers - Integers, floats
2-Strings - Any data under single quote, double quote or backtick quote
3-Booleans - true or false value
4-Null - empty value or no value
5-Undefined - a declared variable without a value
6-Symbol - A unique value that can be generated by Symbol constructor

<mark>Primitive data types are immutable(non-modifiable) data types. Once a primitive data type is created we cannot modify it.</mark>

### Example
```
let word = 'JavaScript'
word[0]='d';

console.log(word);
```


### Non-primitive data types in JavaScript includes:

<mark>Non-primitive data types are modifiable or mutable. We can modify the value of non-primitive data types after it gets created. </mark>

### Example 
```
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
nums[0] = 10

console.log(nums)  // [10, 2, 3]
```

### an array, which is a non-primitive data type is mutable. Non-primitive data types cannot be compared by value. Even if two non-primitive data types have the same properties and values, they are not strictly equal.

1-Objects
2-Arrays

## Numbers 
## MATH OBJECTS

## string methods
